![Demo GIF](demo.gif)

## Overview

This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and display emotions through facial expressions. It detects facial features in real-time or on static images/videos, analyzes the detected faces to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc., and visualizes these emotions through graphical or textual output.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed
- Emotion recognition on static images
- Support for multiple emotions classification
- Visualization of detected emotions on faces

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning model)
- Other dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
